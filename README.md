PHP classes for dealing with the Austrian Registrierkassenverordnung

This project contains classes for generating the data for the mandatory QR code on each receipt according to the "Registrierkassenverordnung". These codes are mandatory on each receipt handed out for cash turnovers.

For further details of the Registrierkassenverordnung please refer to the informations found by your favorite search engine.

The code for generating the QR code itself is currently not included. This classes just generate the data that is to be encoded in the QR code.

Be aware, that you use this code at your own risk! I do not give any guaranties, that the output of these classes comply with the Austrian Registrierkassenverordnung!
